# Medium Stories API
Medium does not provide API for getting stories per user. If you are looking for this right now. You could use this API. I have built the REST API for getting stories per user from RSS Feed Medium. I convert the RSS format to JSON.

## How to use
Fetching the data from this URL. Use **username** as parameter in the end of URL.
